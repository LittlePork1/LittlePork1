# **ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm LittlePork1!**

## I'm a hobbyist developer who codes in my free time, creating projects that I enjoy and find fun. My main focus is on FiveM, where I develop custom Lua scripts using the QbCore framework. I also have experience with HTML, CSS, and basic Python.

**ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve recently finished working on:**

    Go-Fast: A custom FiveM script that [briefly describe what it does, e.g., enables fast-paced getaway scenarios].
    Mission_CarDealer: A FiveM script where car dealers can take on side jobs to deliver random vehicles to clients.

**ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:**

    Improving my skills in Lua and QbCore for more advanced FiveM scripts.
    Expanding my basic Python knowledge for small tasks and automation.

**âš¡ Fun fact:**

    I code what I like and love the process of creating new scripts for the FiveM community!
