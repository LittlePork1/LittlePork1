# **ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm LittlePork1!**

## I'm a hobbyist developer who codes in my free time, creating projects that I enjoy and find fun. My main focus is on FiveM, where I develop custom Lua scripts using the QbCore framework. I also have experience with HTML, CSS, and basic Python.

**ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve recently finished working on:**

    ðŸŒ¿ Developing my first complete FiveM job script â€” **QBX-TABAC**, a tobacco job for QBX Core with harvesting, processing, and selling mechanics.
    ðŸŒ® QBX-TACOS: A custom Taco Hut job for QBX Core featuring crafting systems for tacos and drinks, interactive zones with ox_target, animations, and a full job progression.

**ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:**

    Improving my skills in Lua and QbCore for more advanced FiveM scripts.
    Expanding my basic Python knowledge for small tasks and automation.


**âš¡ Fun fact:**

    I code what I like and love the process of creating new scripts for the FiveM community!
